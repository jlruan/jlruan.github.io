I used Onshape to designed the slip ring assembly for the reel of the robot to allow for easy unspooling for long distance data acquisition and worked on a data parser to sync the data collected by the robot's onboard sensors and cameras for more precise research and location identification. I presented our findings at the United States Department of Agricultureâ€™s Ames National Laboratory with two other senior lab members.
