I used Onshape to designed the slip ring assembly for the reel of the robot to allow for easy unspooling for long distance data acquisition. I also worked on the data parser to sync the data collected by the robot's onboard sensors and it's cameras for more precise research and location identification. I presented our findings at the United States Department of Agricultureâ€™s Ames National Laboratory with two more senior lab members.

In the picture, the robot's being disassembled since this is an ongoing project. I cannot publicize pictures of it completed.
