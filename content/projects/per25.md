I designed chassis closeouts and the battery mounts using NX, validating them in ANSYS to meet both structural and aerodynamic requirements. This role enhanced my mechanical design capabilities and further strengthened my proficiency at CAD. I also manufactured closeouts, chassis tubes, welding jig, and other parts of the PER 2025 competition car using various composites or manufacturing techniques.
