I designed chassis closeouts using NX, validating them in ANSYS to meet both structural and aerodynamic requirements. This role enhanced my mechanical design capabilities and further strengthened my proficiency at CAD. I also manufactured closeouts, chassis tubes, and other parts of the PER 2025 competition car using various composites or manufacturing techniques.
