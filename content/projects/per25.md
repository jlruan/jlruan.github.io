I designed multiple parts on the 2025 Purdue Electric Racing Car in NX. These include driver harnessing tabs, chassis closeouts, and battery mounts using NX as well as validating them in ANSYS to meet both structural and aerodynamic requirements. This role enhanced my mechanical design capabilities and further strengthened my proficiency at CAD. I also manufactured the closeouts, chassis tubes, welding jig, and other parts of the PER 2025 competition car using various composites manufacturing or conventional manufacturing techniques.
