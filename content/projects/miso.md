At the end of 2023, I founded a rookie FIRST Robotics team and fundraised over $30K for competition and robot costs. During the 2024 season, I designed multiple subsystems on our award-winning competition robot which ranked as high as  20th offensively out of 3,500 teams worldwide. I also developed computer vision systems using PhotonVision to detect game objectives and utilized it in autonomous routines, allowing for real-time decision making to aid in gameplay.
