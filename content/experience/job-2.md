##### Skills: CAD, Onshape, Rapid Prototyping, Technical Documentation, Product Design

My team collaborated with Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, Colombia to monitor the ecosystem around the university. I used Onshape to design multiple low-cost wildlife camera housings utilizing bird feeders to prevent theft. These housings were designed to be easy to manufacture through a variety of methods such as additively through a consumer FDM printer or on a jigsaw with a paper template to match the project partner's needs.
