I developed low-cost inertia measuring and position estimation solutions to study animal behavior patterns as well as designed soft robotic limbs to assist in locomotion when traversing difficult terrain. I also researched quadruped motion with artifical limbs to enhance agility and manueverability under Associate Professor Upinder Kaur.
