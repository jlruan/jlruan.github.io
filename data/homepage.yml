  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      I'm very driven and I always love to learn. I would describe myself as a fast learner, not because of some innate talent or anything, but because I try to do what I love and I try to love what I do. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I am a jack of all trades. My profile is a hybrid of mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering more often than not blended into something related to robotics. I'm interested in economics, devops, cybersecurity, as well as robotics as careers which is a weird mix, I know.

But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, itâ€™s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression."
