  title: "Who am I?"
  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      I'm very driven and I always love to learn. My greatest strength is my work ethic, as I have no qualms putting in the hours in order to make something work.  I would describe myself as a fast learner, not because I can grasp concepts instantly but because I'll work on it day and night until I get it.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I am a jack of all trades. My profile is a hybrid of mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering more often than not blended into something related to robotics. I'm interested in economics, devops, cybersecurity, as well as robotics so hit me up if you're interested in talking shop.

But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, itâ€™s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression."
