      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2023, I founded a rookie FIRST Robotics team and fundraised over $30K for competition and robot costs. During the 2024 season, I designed multiple subsystems on our award-winning competition robot which ranked as high as 20th offensively out of 3,500 teams worldwide. I also developed computer vision and localization systems using PhotonVision to detect game objectives and utilized it in autonomous routines, allowing for real-time decision making to aid in gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed multiple parts on the 2025 Purdue Electric Racing Car in NX. These include driver harnessing tabs, chassis closeouts, and battery mounts using NX as well as validating them in ANSYS to meet both structural and aerodynamic requirements. This role enhanced my mechanical design capabilities and further strengthened my proficiency at CAD. I also manufactured the closeouts, chassis tubes, welding jig, and other parts of the PER 2025 competition car using various composites manufacturing or conventional manufacturing techniques. More pictures can be found in my portfolio linked above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used Onshape to designed the slip ring assembly for the reel of the robot to allow for easy unspooling for long distance data acquisition and worked on a data parser to sync the data collected by the robot&amp;rsquo;s onboard sensors and cameras for more precise research and location identification. I presented our findings at the United States Department of Agricultureâ€™s Ames National Laboratory with two other senior lab members.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
