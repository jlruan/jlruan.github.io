      <description>&lt;p&gt;My team collaborated with Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, Colombia to monitor the ecosystem around the university. I used Onshape to design multiple low-cost wildlife camera housings utilizing bird feeders to prevent theft. These housings were designed to be easy to manufacture through a variety of methods such as additively through a consumer FDM printer or on a jigsaw with a paper template to match the project partnerâ€™s needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2023, I founded a rookie FIRST Robotics team and fundraised over $30K for competition and robot costs. During the 2024 season, I designed multiple subsystems on our award-winning competition robot which ranked as high as  20th offensively out of 3,500 teams worldwide. I also developed computer vision systems using PhotonVision to detect game objectives and utilized it in autonomous routines, allowing for real-time decision making to aid in gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
